## How to use

The easiest way to get started is to build and launch the containers:

1. `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker-compose up --env-file docker-compose.env --profile process-audio`
2. Browse to https://localhost:3000

## Development

To run all services in watch mode:

1. `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker-compose --env-file docker-compose.env -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up`
2. Browse to https://localhost:4000

Tailing logs:

`docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs --follow`

Running with a GPU:

`DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker-compose --env-file docker-compose.env -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.gpu.yml up --profile process-audio`
